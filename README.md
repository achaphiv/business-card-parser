Problem
=======

Weâ€™ve created a new smartphone app that enables users to snap a photo of a business card and have the information from the card automatically extracted and added to their contact list. We need you to write the component that parses the results of the optical character recognition (OCR) component in order to extract the name, phone number, and email address from the processed business card image. We have provided you with a basic specification [1] and a series of example inputs [2] and would like you to provide the implementation.

[1] INTERFACE SPECIFICATION

~~~
ContactInfo
    String getName() : returns the full name of the individual (eg. John Smith, Susan Malick)
    String getPhoneNumber() : returns the phone number formatted as a sequence of digits
    String getEmailAddress() : returns the email address

BusinessCardParser
    ContactInfo getContactInfo(String document)

How
===

The current implementation uses [libphonenumber](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber) and [opennlp](https://opennlp.apache.org/).

Possible improvements
=====================

* Better handle possible `key: value` hints.
  * E.G. `Name: John Doe` or `Email: foo@bar.com`
* Pull out other data
  * E.G. `address` or `job title`
* Handle more complicated email addresses
* Handle more complicated phone numbers
